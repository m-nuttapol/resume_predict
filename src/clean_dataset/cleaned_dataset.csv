WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.
OTHER PROJECTS
Title : Diabetes Detection
Brief : Developed the software which can detect whether the person is suffering from Diabetes or not and got the third
prize in it.

Migration of data from RDBMS database to Hive (Hadoop ecosystem) . Hadoop platform ability with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The objective of this project was to speed up the data processing so that the analysis and decision making become easy. Due to RDBMS limitations to process waste amount of data at once and produce the results at the earliest, Client wanted to move the data to Hadoop ecosystem so that they can over-come from those limitations and focus on business improvement only.

Responsibility 1. Optimising the SQL queries for those data which were not required to move from RDBMS to any other platform.
2. Writing the Hive queries and logic to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop ecosystem.
3. Writing the hive queries to analyse the required data as per the business requirements.
4. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.
5. Writing the sqoop commands and scripts to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop side.

Project Description:
The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds.

These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer. The reconciliation tool is
designed to source data from an ETL layer. The data from the Front and Back office systems,
together with static data must therefore be delivered to ETL. Here it will be pre-processed and delivered to reconciliation tool before the reconciliation process can be performed.
